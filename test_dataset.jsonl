Here are the RESTful endpoint paths you provided: (\"/\", \"/score\") Based on these paths, here are the ones that require an entity ID to access and where you can get it from: * Path: \"/\" - This path does not require an entity ID. You can retrieve a list of all entities by calling the `/entities` endpoint without any parameters. * Path: \"/score\" - To retrieve a specific score for an entity, you need to provide the entity ID in the URL. For example, `GET /score/12345`. If you don't have the entity ID, you can retrieve all scores by calling `/entities` and then filtering the results based on your criteria (e.g., using a query parameter). So, to summarize: * Path: \"/\" - No entity ID required, get all entities from `/entities`. * Path: \"/score\" - Requires an entity ID in the URL, retrieve it from `/entities` or use a different path if you have other information about the entity."}

However, if you want to retrieve specific intent data for a particular entity, you can call the //api/entity path and specify the entity ID in the URL or request body.

What Paths require an entity_id to access and can you get that entity from a different path? If you can which path do you need to call?  [\"//messages/ads\", \"//messages/ads/searchads\"] [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the RESTful endpoint paths you provided: * //messages/ads - This path requires an entity ID to access. To get this entity, you can call the \"/messages\" path and retrieve all messages, then filter them based on the desired criteria (e.g., \"ads\"). * //messages/ads/searchads - This path does not require an entity ID to access. You can directly call this path to retrieve a list of search ads without needing to fetch the entire message collection first. So, in summary: //messages/ads requires an entity ID to access, and you can get it by calling //messages and filtering based on criteria. //messages/ads/searchads does not require an entity ID and can be accessed directly."}

Paths where you can find the entity ID elsewhere: * \"/api/{tenantId}/actions/{name}\" - The name of the action is not enough to identify it, so an entity ID is required for this path as well. You can get the entity ID by calling the \"/api/{tenantId}/entities\" path and retrieving the appropriate entity. Paths that do not require an entity ID: * \"/api/{tenantId}/actions/{name}/{hookName}\" - This path only requires a name and hook name to access the corresponding action resource. No entity ID is required for this path. * \"/api/{tenantId}/execute/{hook}\" - This path does not require any entity IDs, as it is specifically designed to execute a specific action or task without retrieving an entity.
